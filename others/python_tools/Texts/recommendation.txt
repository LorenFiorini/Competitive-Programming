to the admissions office when laura
Sophie Wagner
asked me if I could support her
application to your university
it was not a question of if I would help
her but more of
how i could help her I have known laura
since
2012 when she was only 9 years old as
her music teacher
in 5th grade, i taught her how to play
the tanner saxophone
two years later when she was only 12
years old
she signed up for a school's jazz band
audition which had usually been for 16
to 18-year-olds
soon after she became the youngest
member that the band has ever had
since that day laura has surpassed our
expectations in all areas regarding
effort
passion as well as real real
reliability damn it's such a hard word
sorry she's the best musician
I've ever had one that wouldn't even let
a knee surgery stop her from
performing with her team aka the band
shortly after becoming a member in our
school's band I recognized her
huge potential and nominated her for the
solar chair
as well as overall leading tenor
saxophone
laura showed very early on that she has
the courage as well as the
responsibility to meet those kinds of
challenges
her first solo was Forget You paul
Martha
which lore performed with an
unbelievable amount of emotion and drive
and which always resulted in a standing
ovation
consequently, the band decided to play
her song several times at various
concerts
since that first time, laura has always
performed three to six solos at our
band's concerts
what is extremely special about her is
not only that her musical skills
grabbed the listener's attention but
also her whole appearance her charisma
and her constantly smiling face
laura's commitment and reliability were
extremely impressive during one of our
concerts three days
after complex knee surgery, she found out
that we were
lacking musicians mostly soloists
consequently she backed her parents to
let her play
on crutches that day laura sophie wagner
played until her foot turned blue
i was not only impressed but inspired by
her
as well as very thankful for laura's
commitment and support
in 2018 the school's jazz band took part
in an exchange program
we visited westmont high school illinois
for a week due to
due to the fact that all the students
lived with host families during that
week
laura helped me out by informing me
reliably about all the problems and
needs of her fellow students living in
american families
during this time in the united states it
became clear how trustworthy laura is
and that her leadership qualities are
excellent
simultaneously i noticed how much fun
she had engaging with other people
also in this very short period of time
laura became close friends with her host
family especially with her host sister
this friendship resulted in her host
family inviting her to spend a whole
semester there
one day after coming back from her
exchange here in the us
laura performed with our band again
absolutely jet-lagged she practiced all
the new songs of her
set list in the morning in order to be
on stage together
with the band again in the evening now
i would like to share another example of
laura's determination
while practicing with the school's jazz
band laura and i have gotten to know
each other better
that is why i offered her to substitute
for another more professional jazz band
that i am the band leader of
this band usually only consists of
members and the relatives of vets hoda's
round table club
but laura blended in perfectly which is
why the whole club unanimously voted to
make her the first non-club member
of the band at the gymnasium watson
all the seniors individually choose a
teacher of trust to whom they can turn
whenever they are needed laura chose me
as her teacher of trust
which is why i got to know her even
better i regularly meet with all the
students i am counseling
that is how i know that laura is very
well liked among
her fellow students due to the fact that
she is charismatic
hospitable attentive respectful as well
as funny
finally i can say that laura is a
student who stands out from the crowd of
all students due to her discipline
determination and intelligence
she also impresses everybody through her
passion for life
her reliability and her positive
attitude regarding all
challenges which laura can overcome
easily
i must say that that i admire how laura
sets herself goals and how she meets
them every time
seemingly effortlessly through hard work
supported by her self-confidence in
order to make new experiences
and to broaden her horizons while doing
so
laura is always cheerful respectful to
your fellow students
and kind in my opinion laura would not
only be an outstanding student at your
university
but also in enrichment for this facility
